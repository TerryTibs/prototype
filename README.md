# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

Excellent question. This is the crucial step: moving from a functional prototype to a system with real-world impact. To make it "work for real," we need to upgrade three key areas:

Senses (Input): Give it a connection to a rich, meaningful data source instead of just MNIST.

Purpose (Goal): Give it a clear objective so it knows what kind of rules to invent.

Hands (Action): Give it a way to act on its conclusions in the real world.

Here is a practical, phased roadmap to make this system real.

Phase 1: Grounding in Reality (Senses & Purpose)

The goal of this phase is to connect the "brain" you've built to a real problem domain.

1. Upgrade Its Senses: Choose a Real-World Input

Instead of MNIST images, have it process a stream of meaningful information. The Autoencoder gets replaced with a modern Embedding Model (like a pre-trained Transformer).

Option A: Make it a Code Analyst.

Input: Feed it functions or classes from a real codebase (e.g., a Python project).

Embedding: Use a code-aware model (like CodeBERT) to turn each function into a z vector.

What it will "see": It will start to see patterns in code structure, style, and logic.

Option B: Make it a Data Scientist's Assistant.

Input: Feed it structured logs (e.g., web server logs, application errors).

Embedding: Use a sentence-transformer to embed each log line into a z vector.

What it will "see": It will learn to recognize different types of errors, user behaviors, and system states.

Option C: Make it a Knowledge Worker.

Input: Feed it a stream of text documents (e.g., internal company wikis, news articles).

Embedding: Use a standard text embedding model (like MiniLM).

What it will "see": It will discover thematic clusters and relationships between concepts in the documents.

2. Give It a Purpose: Define a "Prime Directive"

A real system needs a goal. This goal guides the MetaController in what kinds of rules to propose. The system's objective should be to propose rules that help it optimize a measurable metric.

For the Code Analyst:

Goal: "Propose rules that reduce code complexity."

Metric: Measure the cyclomatic complexity or code duplication score of a function. The system will favor proposing rules (e.g., for refactoring) that lead to lower complexity scores.

For the Data Scientist's Assistant:

Goal: "Propose rules that improve the classification of log messages."

Metric: The accuracy of a simple classifier built on top of the symbol centroids. The system will favor proposing rules that create cleaner, more distinct Symbol clusters.

For the Knowledge Worker:

Goal: "Propose rules that create better summaries of related documents."

Metric: A semantic similarity score between a synthesized "abstraction" vector and the documents it's supposed to represent.

Outcome of Phase 1: You now have an SRA that is grounded. It's not just thinking about abstract digits; it's analyzing real code (or logs, or text) with a specific mission.

Phase 2: Scaling the Mind (Intelligence & Language)

The system is grounded, now we need to make it smarter and its internal language more expressive.

1. Enrich the Symbolic Language (SUL)

The current Symbol is just an ID and a vector. Let's give it a human-readable name.

Action: When a new Symbol is created by the SUL, use a Large Language Model (LLM) to "name" it.

Process: Feed the LLM a few example members (e.g., the code snippets or log lines) of the new symbol cluster and ask it: "Give a short, descriptive name for these items."

Result: Instead of just "Symbol 17," the system's internal monologue now uses concepts like "Symbol_Handles_Database_Connection_Errors". This makes its proposed rules instantly understandable to the human operator.

2. Enhance the Creative Engine (RUS)

The current RUS just averages vectors. Let's make its creativity more sophisticated.

Action: When a contradiction is detected, use an LLM to synthesize the new abstraction.

Process: Give the LLM the two conflicting items (e.g., two code functions) and prompt it: "Here are two different code functions that my system flagged as a conceptual contradiction. Please write a new, more abstract function that unifies their core logic."

Result: The new "abstraction" isn't just a mathematical average; it's a genuinely new piece of code or text. The embedding of this new artifact becomes the z_star vector.

Outcome of Phase 2: The system's internal language is now human-readable, and its ability to create new concepts is far more powerful and generative.

Phase 3: Giving It Hands (Action & Impact)

The system can now think about real problems and propose intelligent rules. Now, let's allow those rules to have a tangible effect.

1. Define Real-World Transforms

The transform_py part of a Rule should now output a concrete action in a standardized format.

For the Code Analyst:

Transform Output: A git diff patch. The rule doesn't just suggest a change; it generates the exact code change.

Human Approval: The web dashboard now shows you the proposed diff. You are approving a specific code modification.

For the Data Scientist's Assistant:

Transform Output: A SQL query or a Python script for generating a new plot.

Human Approval: The dashboard shows the query to be run. You approve its execution.

2. Evolve the Sandbox

The sandbox must be upgraded to safely test these new actions.

For git diff: The sandbox needs a temporary, disposable copy of the codebase where it can apply the patch and run unit tests. A rule is only valid if the patch applies cleanly and all tests pass.

For SQL queries: The sandbox executes the query against a read-only replica of the database with a LIMIT clause.

Outcome of Phase 3: You have a closed loop. The system analyzes the real world, proposes a tangible change, that change is safely tested, and upon your approval, it is applied, thus altering the very world the system is observing.

The Final Picture

After these three phases, your system is no longer a prototype. It is a real, working partner.

It might be a Junior Developer that constantly looks over your codebase, finds patterns of repetitive or complex code, and submits pull requests for refactoring that you can review and merge.

Or it might be a Tireless Security Analyst that watches application logs, discovers a new pattern of suspicious behavior, proposes a new rule to formally identify it, and once you approve, that rule becomes part of your live intrusion detection system.

You're not just building a tool; you're cultivating a collaborator. The foundation you've built is the key, and this roadmap shows how to connect it to reality.
